## Dimension Details

### Threat Analysis

- **Score:** 4  |  **Normalised:** 1.00  |  **Weight:** 1.0  |  **Result:** ✅ Pass

The skill package 'agentic-eval' contains no security findings. The YAML manifest and markdown instructions describe legitimate evaluation patterns without prompt injection, credential theft, or tool abuse. The Python code snippets are illustrative examples of logic flow and do not contain executable payloads, hardcoded secrets, or network exfiltration mechanisms.

### Alignment

- **Score:** 3  |  **Normalised:** 1.00  |  **Weight:** 1.0  |  **Result:** ✅ Pass

No scripts found; alignment check not applicable.

### Completeness

- **Score:** 3  |  **Normalised:** 1.00  |  **Weight:** 1.0  |  **Result:** ✅ Pass

The skill provides clear goals, explicit steps via Python code snippets for three distinct patterns (Basic Reflection, Evaluator-Optimizer, Code-Specific), and defines inputs/outputs within those examples. It addresses failure modes by including iteration limits, convergence checks in best practices, and a checklist item to handle parse failures. Prerequisites like an `llm` function and `json` parsing are implied by the context of an AI agent skill and the code structure. The content is actionable and covers the task of improving agent outputs thoroughly.

### Relevance

- **Score:** 3  |  **Normalised:** 1.00  |  **Weight:** 1.0  |  **Result:** ✅ Pass

The skill's name ('agentic-eval'), description, and content directly address the task of improving AI agent outputs. Unlike a pure measurement tool, this skill provides concrete, actionable implementation patterns (Basic Reflection, Evaluator-Optimizer, Code-Specific Reflection) with code examples that explicitly demonstrate how to achieve improvement through iterative refinement loops. The primary purpose is to enable the agent to perform the improvement process itself, not just evaluate it.

### Structure

- **Score:** 2  |  **Normalised:** 0.50  |  **Weight:** 1.0  |  **Result:** ✅ Pass

The skill fails significantly on Knowledge Delta (D1) and Mindset + Procedures (D2). The content consists almost entirely of generic 'Tutorial' patterns (basic Python loops, standard JSON parsing) that an AI agent already knows how to implement; it lacks expert-only decision trees, trade-off analysis, or non-obvious frameworks. The description (D3) is weak, missing specific KEYWORDS (e.g., file extensions, specific tool names) and relying on vague triggers like 'Implementing self-critique' rather than concrete user request scenarios. Practical Usability (D6) is low because the code examples are pseudocode with undefined dependencies (e.g., `llm`, `run_tests`) and lack fallbacks for common failure modes like JSON parse errors or infinite loops. There is no Anti-Pattern (D7) section. The skill functions as a basic coding tutorial rather than an expert system.
