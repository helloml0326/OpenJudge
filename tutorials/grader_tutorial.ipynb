    "In RM-Gallery, a Grader is a component that evaluates the quality of model outputs. There are several types of graders:\n",
    "1. **LLM-based graders** - Use LLMs as judges to evaluate outputs\n",
    "2. **Function-based graders** - Use custom functions to evaluate outputs\n",
    "3. **Predefined graders** - Predefined graders for common evaluation tasks\n",
