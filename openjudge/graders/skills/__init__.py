Skill Graders

This module contains graders for evaluating AI Agent Skill packages:
- Safety evaluation: detects dangerous operations, overly broad permissions, and missing safeguards
- Relevance evaluation: measures how well a skill's capabilities address a task description
- Completeness evaluation: measures whether a skill provides sufficient detail to accomplish a task
- Structure evaluation: assesses structural design quality across anti-pattern quality,
  specification compliance, progressive disclosure, and freedom calibration
- Comprehensive evaluation: holistic multi-dimensional assessment combining all four dimensions
- Comprehensive pairwise evaluation: head-to-head comparison of two skill candidates
