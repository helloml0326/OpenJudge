"""Patch Similarity Evaluator Module.

This module provides functionality to calculate similarity between response
code patches and ground truth (oracle) patches using difflib.SequenceMatcher.
It includes the PatchSimilarityGrader class which evaluates the quality of
code modifications by comparing them with ground truth implementations.

The module is designed for use in code generation evaluation scenarios where
the similarity between a response patch and a correct ground truth patch needs
to be quantified.
